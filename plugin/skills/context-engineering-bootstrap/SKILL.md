# Skill: Baseline ContextSet Bootstrapping

## Goal
From a target database and optional user-supplied enrichment sources (design docs, ORM models, sample SQL, glossary), produce a baseline `ContextSet` JSON at a caller-specified path. Optionally upload to the Context Store and return the resource name.

## Prerequisites
- A working DB connection — Toolbox MCP tools (`<source>-list-schemas`) must be visible to the agent throughout the run. If missing or unreachable at any point, stop and route through `context-engineering-init`; do not work around it (no bash `uvx toolbox-server invoke` fallback).
- Target output path for the ContextSet JSON. If not supplied, prompt the user; default `./bootstrap_context.json` at cwd.
- (Optional) Design docs, application code, sample SQL, glossary, or other enrichment sources.
- (Optional, for upload) Context Store resource coordinates — see the `upload_context_set` tool for required fields.

## Guidance

1. **Confirm scope with the user:**
   - Which Toolbox `<source>` to introspect (auto-select if exactly one supported source exists in `tools.yaml`; otherwise prompt).
   - Which schemas / tables to focus on (or all, if the DB is small).
   - Output path for the ContextSet JSON.
   - Whether to upload to Context Store after generation; if yes, collect the resource coordinates required by `upload_context_set`.

2. **Collect enrichment sources:** prompt for design docs, ORM models, sample SQL, glossary, etc. Wait for the user's response before proceeding.

3. **Deduce Key Info (Core Execution):**
   - **Targeted Schema & Graph Retrieval**: Informed by the ingested application artifacts and design docs, use the available Toolbox MCP tools configured in the active `autoctx/tools.yaml` (e.g., `<source>-list-schemas`, `<source>-list-graphs`) to fetch the schemas for the target database and relevant tables/graphs.
   - Present the retrieved schema summary **structurally and cleanly** to the user. Ask the user if they want to filter or focus on specific schemas, tables, or graphs.
   - Perform a **deep analysis** of the retrieved **schema and any provided documentation or code** to identify important concepts, relationships, and likely query patterns.
   - **GQL Preference for Graph Entities**: When querying entities or relationships that are modeled within a property graph, **always prefer GQL (`GRAPH <graph_name> MATCH ...`)** over writing relational SQL `JOIN` queries against the underlying node/edge tables.
   - **Collect Candidates**: Identify representative natural language queries with their corresponding SQL/GQL, common filter conditions or business rules (and graph pattern facets), and **columns that require specialized value searching** (e.g., names needing fuzzy match, descriptions needing semantic search).
   - *Review Check:* Briefly display these candidates to the user for approval or modifications before proceeding.  

4. **Identify candidate items:** analyze schema + enrichment to identify representative NLQ + SQL pairs (Templates), common filter fragments (Facets), and columns needing fuzzy/semantic matching (Value Searches). Present the candidates to the user for review before generating.

5. **Generate the ContextSet:** invoke the `context-engineering-generation-guide` skill with the approved candidates. Save items incrementally to the output path via the `mutate_context_set` MCP tool. For a new file, construct `"operation": "add"` mutations for each item.

6. **Validate**: Call `validate_context_set` on `bootstrap_context.json`. If invalid, fix each issue via `mutate_context_set` and re-validate until clean. Stop after two failed attempts and surface remaining issues to the user.

8. **Optionally upload:** if the user opted to upload, call `upload_context_set`.

9. **Summarize:** report the local file path and (if uploaded) the resource name.

## Rules
- Caller supplies (or explicitly confirms a default for) the output path.
- Never upload without explicit user consent.
- Always use the `mutate_context_set` MCP tool for ContextSet file changes — pass mutation payloads directly. Do not read the target file beforehand.
- Do not invoke `context-engineering-evaluate` or `context-engineering-hillclimb`.

## Tools

**MCP:**
- `<source>-list-schemas` (Toolbox) — schema introspection.
- `mutate_context_set` — incremental writes to the output JSON.
- `upload_context_set` → `cs_resource_name` — optional Context Store upload.

**Sibling skill:**
- `context-engineering-generation-guide` — produces well-formed Template / Facet / Value Search JSON. Also the reference for context-item schema and authoring standards.
