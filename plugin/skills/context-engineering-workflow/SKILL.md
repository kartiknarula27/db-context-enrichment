name: context-engineering-workflow
description: Use this skill when the user is new to context engineering, asks how to get started, or is unsure which peer skill to invoke. Explains the ContextSet concepts (Templates, Facets, Value Searches), the optimization lifecycle, and routes to the right peer skill (init, dataset-generation, bootstrap, evaluate, hillclimb) based on the user's current state.

# Skill: Context Engineering Lifecycle

This skill defines the shared vocabulary, lifecycle, and safety rules used by the `context-engineering-*` peer skills. Consult it to orient before invoking a peer, or when a rule reads as "cross-cutting."

---

## Shared Terminology

A **ContextSet** is the structured knowledge blob the Gemini Data Analytics API consumes when translating a natural-language question to SQL. It contains three item types:

*   **Template** — a full NLQ → SQL mapping, generalized with placeholders (e.g., `$1`, `$2`). Teaches end-to-end query patterns.
*   **Facet** — a reusable SQL fragment (e.g., a `WHERE` predicate or a specialized join), tied to specific vocabulary. Composed into generated queries dynamically.
*   **Value Search** — a query that maps user-supplied terms (with typos, casing differences, or synonyms) to their exact database values. Resolves the value-linking problem.

See [context-engineering-generation-guide](../context-engineering-generation-guide/SKILL.md) for the JSON schemas and dialect-specific authoring standards.

## The Optimization Lifecycle & Phase Flow

To build high-performing data applications, context engineers typically follow a systematic, iterative optimization lifecycle (Hill-Climbing).

## Where to Start

If you're new, invoke the peer that matches your current state:

*   No `.context-engineering/tools.yaml` → [context-engineering-init](../context-engineering-init/SKILL.md)
*   No golden dataset → [context-engineering-dataset-generation](../context-engineering-dataset-generation/SKILL.md)
*   No base ContextSet → [context-engineering-bootstrap](../context-engineering-bootstrap/SKILL.md)
*   Have a base ContextSet and want autonomous improvement → [context-engineering-hillclimb](../context-engineering-hillclimb/SKILL.md)
*   Have a ContextSet and just want to score it → [context-engineering-evaluate](../context-engineering-evaluate/SKILL.md)

Experienced users can skip this section and invoke any peer directly.

## Workflow Phases, Rationales & Entry Prerequisites

---

### Setup & Connection Configuration
*   **Reference**: [context-engineering-init](../context-engineering-init/SKILL.md)
*   **Goal**: Configure `.context-engineering/tools.yaml` for the Toolbox MCP server and verify runtime + GCP setup (uv, evalbench, ADC, Dataplex/GDA APIs, IAM).

---

### Evaluation Dataset Prep & Expansion
*   **Reference**: [context-engineering-dataset-generation](../context-engineering-dataset-generation/SKILL.md)
*   **Goal**: Build a high-quality "golden" ground-truth NLQ+SQL dataset for evaluating translation accuracy.
*   **Requires**: Setup & Connection Configuration complete.

---

### Baseline Context Bootstrapping
*   **Reference**: [context-engineering-bootstrap](../context-engineering-bootstrap/SKILL.md)
*   **Goal**: Generate a baseline `ContextSet` (Templates, Facets, Value Searches) from database schema and optional enrichment sources.
*   **Requires**: Setup & Connection Configuration complete.

---

### Evaluation Scoring
*   **Reference**: [context-engineering-evaluate](../context-engineering-evaluate/SKILL.md)
*   **Goal**: Run Evalbench against a ContextSet + golden dataset to produce an accuracy score and per-query failure breakdown.
*   **Requires**: Setup & Connection Configuration complete; a golden dataset and a ContextSet (local file or Context Store resource name) available.

---

### Autonomous Optimization
*   **Reference**: [context-engineering-hillclimb](../context-engineering-hillclimb/SKILL.md)
*   **Goal**: Autonomously iterate evaluate → analyze → mutate → re-upload until improvements dry up, producing a high-scoring ContextSet with no per-iteration user approval.
*   **Requires**: Setup & Connection Configuration complete; a golden dataset. The base context is optional — hillclimb invokes bootstrap when none is supplied.
*   **Note**: Hillclimb runs evaluate itself every iteration; do not run Evaluation Scoring separately as a precondition.

---

## Safety & Protocol

*   **Unconfigured Database & MCP Tool Probing**:
    *   Before calling any database MCP tools (such as `<source>-list-schemas`, `<source>-list-graphs`, `<source>-execute-sql`), verify whether `autoctx/tools.yaml` exists and is configured.
    *   **Strictly Forbidden**: If `autoctx/tools.yaml` is missing or unverified, you are **strictly forbidden from proceeding**.
    *   **Mandatory Action**: You **MUST immediately halt and yield the turn** to solicit the database connection parameters (Project ID, Instance ID, Database ID, Dialect [for Spanner: GoogleSQL vs. PostgreSQL], and any target tables/property graphs) and an experiment name from the user. Do not proceed on the workflow until the user provides this information.

*   **Missing Dataset**:
    *   If the user's request requires **evaluating, scoring, or optimizing** a context set (e.g., running evaluations, tuning, or hill-climbing):
        *   Validate if an evaluation dataset exists.
        *   **Mandatory Halt & Guide**: If no evaluation dataset exists, you are **strictly forbidden** from executing any context bootstrapping, tuning, or evaluation operations in this turn. You must immediately halt, stop calling tools, and yield the turn. Explain **why a golden evaluation dataset is critical** for context engineering (i.e., you cannot objectively score, validate, or hill-climb translation accuracy without a ground-truth dataset), and ask if they would like help generating one first.

*   **Critical API Error Protocol**:
    *   Seek guidance from the user if you run into results where retrying is unlikely to solve the issue.
    *   Examples:`503` or `429` error, `UNAVAILABLE` or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` status code.
    *   Why: These errors are often associated with quota issues, and retrying the request immediately will not resolve the issue. For issues related to Vertex AI Resource Exhaustion, retrying at a later time is often the only solution.

*   **Environment failures**: For any environment or connection failure (missing `tools.yaml`, MCP tools unreachable, ADC not configured, API not enabled, IAM missing), route through [context-engineering-init](../context-engineering-init/SKILL.md) to diagnose and fix. Do not invent workarounds (e.g., calling Toolbox via bash instead of MCP).
